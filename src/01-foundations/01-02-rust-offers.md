## Safety, Performance, Predictability

Rust is often praised for its speed and memory safety, but in the world of cryptographic engineering, these traits aren't just nice-to-haves — they're critical.

### Safety

Bugs in cryptographic code can be catastrophic. Memory corruption, undefined behavior, or uninitialized values can leak secrets or open attack vectors. Rust eliminates entire classes of these bugs at compile time:

- No nulls
- No uninitialized memory
- No data races
- No buffer overflows

This safety isn't enforced by a runtime, but by the **borrow checker** at compile time. That makes Rust extremely attractive for writing low-level cryptographic code **without sacrificing control**.

### ️Performance

Rust compiles to fast native code, comparable to C and C++. There’s no garbage collector, and you pay only for what you use. This matters because cryptography is often used in:

- Performance-critical code paths (e.g. TLS handshakes, file encryption)
- Embedded systems where CPU cycles and memory are limited

Rust lets you stay close to the metal while writing high-level abstractions — it’s a rare balance.

### Predictability

In cryptography, **predictable behavior** is essential. You need fine-grained control over:

- **Timing** — Avoid accidental leaks via early-exit comparisons or branching on secrets
- **Memory** — Prevent unexpected reallocations or optimization side effects
- **Execution** — Ensure constant-time logic without interference from JITs or hidden runtime behavior

Rust gives you this control by default, making it a strong ally in defending against side-channel attacks.

> In short: Rust brings the low-level control of C, the safety of functional languages, and the clarity of modern syntax — all in a single toolchain. That’s why cryptographers and security engineers are increasingly turning to it.
