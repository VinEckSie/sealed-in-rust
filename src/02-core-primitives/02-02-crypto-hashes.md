## Cryptographic Hashes — SHA-2, BLAKE3 & Beyond

> 🔐 **Used in:** password storage, digital signatures, blockchains, TLS, integrity checks
>
> ✅ One-way, deterministic, and foundational to *all* modern cryptography


### What Is a Cryptographic Hash?
A cryptographic hash function takes arbitrary input data and produces a fixed-size output, called a *digest*.

Key properties:

- Deterministic:  same input → same output
- One-way:  infeasible to recover the input
- Collision-resistant:  infeasible to find two inputs with the same hash
- Avalanche effect:  tiny input change → completely different output

**Hash functions are not encryption.There is no key. There is no decryption.**

They exist to answer one question: *“Has this data changed — and can I trust it?”*

### What Hashes Are Used For (Real Systems)
- Password storage (never store plaintext passwords)
- Digital signatures (hash → sign)
- TLS certificates (hashing messages before authentication)
- Package managers (verify downloads)
- Git (content-addressed storage)
- Blockchains (immutability and chaining)

**If symmetric ciphers protect confidentiality, hashes protect integrity and identity.**


### One-Way by Design

Consider this:

```text
"hello"  →  2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e...
"hellO"  →  0d4a1185eecb25c46b7a5d3bca4f4f8b...

One flipped bit >> Completely different output
```

This is not accidental — it’s the core security property.

### SHA-2 — The Conservative Standard
> 💡 Used in TLS, certificates, package signing, blockchains. Stable, conservative, and widely trusted

SHA-2[^SHA2] is a family of hash functions standardized by NIST[^NIST]:
- SHA-224[^SHA224]
- SHA-256[^SHA256]
- SHA-384[^SHA384]
- SHA-512[^SHA512]

SHA-256 is the most common.
It is slow enough to be secure, fast enough for general use and extremely well analyzed.
SHA-2 is boring and that’s a compliment.

🧪 **Code Example: SHA-256 Hashing** ([source code](https://github.com/VinEckSie/sealed-in-rust/blob/main/rust_crypto_book_code/src/lib.rs))

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../../rust_crypto_book_code/src/lib.rs:sha256}}
```

Output:
```text
SHA-256: b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9
```

Same input. Same output. Always.

> **🟢 Conclusion**
> SHA-2 is the safe default.
> If you don’t know which hash to use, SHA-256 will almost never be the wrong answer.

### Why Hashes Are Not Password Protection
If you do this, you are already vulnerable.
```rust,no_run
hash(password)
```
because Hashes are fast, attackers can try billions per second, rainbow tables exist.

We fix this with KDFs[^KDF] (Argon2[^ARGON2], scrypt[^SCRYPT]). See [Key Derivation section](../02-core-primitives/02-01-symmetric-ciphers.md#a-glimpse-at-key-derivation)

### BLAKE3 — Modern, Fast, and Parallel
>💡 Used in modern systems, content addressing, integrity pipelines. Extremely fast, secure, and designed for today’s hardware

BLAKE3[^BLAKE3] is the modern evolution of BLAKE2:
- Cryptographically secure
- Massively parallel
- Faster than SHA-2
- Designed for multicore CPUs and SIMD[^SIMD]
- Unlike SHA-2, BLAKE3 was designed after modern hardware existed.

It also supports:
- Streaming
- Incremental hashing[^INC]
- Keyed hashing[^KEY]
- Extendable output (XOF)[^EXT]

🧪 **Code Example: BLAKE3 Hashing** ([source code](https://github.com/VinEckSie/sealed-in-rust/blob/main/rust_crypto_book_code/src/lib.rs))

```rust,no_run
{{#include ../../rust_crypto_book_code/src/lib.rs:blake3}}
```

Output:
```text
BLAKE3: d74981efa70a0c880b8d8c1985d075dbcbf679b99a5f9914e5aaf96b831a9e24
```

### SHA-2 vs. BLAKE3 — Which Should You Use?

| Property       | SHA-256              | BLAKE3             |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Standardized   | ✅ Yes               | ❌ Not NIST         |
| Speed          | ⚠️ Moderate          | 🚀 Extremely fast   |
| Parallelism    | ❌ Limited           | ✅ Built-in         |
| Maturity       | 🧱 Very conservative | 🧠 Modern design    |
| Simplicity     | ✅ Simple            | ✅ Simple           |
| Use cases      | ✅ Compliance        | ✅ Performance      |
|                | ✅ Interoperability  | ✅ Content hashing  |
|                |                      | ✅ Modern systems   |


### Collision Resistance — What “Breaking a Hash” Really Means
Breaking a hash means one of two things:
- Finding a collision[^COLLISION] faster than brute force[^BRUTEFORCE]
- Finding a preimage[^PREIMAGE] faster than brute force

For SHA-256:
- No practical attacks exist
- Collision cost ≈ 2¹²⁸
- Preimage cost ≈ 2²⁵⁶

That is astronomically infeasible.

> 💡 Most real-world failures come from misuse, not broken math.

### Hashes in Real Protocols
Hashes are rarely used alone.

They appear inside:
- HMAC — keyed hashing for authentication
- HKDF — key derivation
- Digital signatures — sign(hash(message))
- Merkle trees[^MERKLE] — integrity structures
- Password KDFs — slow hashing

> **🟢 Conclusion**
>
>Hash functions provide integrity, not secrecy.
>
>They are one-way by design:
>- SHA-2 is conservative and universal
>- BLAKE3 is modern, fast, and scalable
>Hashes alone are not password protection
>
> Cryptographic hashes are the glue of modern security.
>
> They verify data, anchor trust, protect identities, and power nearly every cryptographic construction you’ll encounter.
> If encryption hides secrets, hashes define truth.
