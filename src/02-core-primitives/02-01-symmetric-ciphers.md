## Symmetric Ciphers: XOR, AES, ChaCha20 & Beyond

> üîê **Used in:** VPNs, TLS (post-handshake), disk encryption, messaging apps  
> ‚úÖ Still foundational in modern cryptography.

### What Are Symmetric Ciphers?

Symmetric ciphers use the **same key** for both encryption and decryption. Unlike public-key cryptography, they don‚Äôt offer key exchange‚Äîbut they are **much faster**, making them ideal for bulk data encryption.

They are used everywhere: encrypted file systems, secure communications, and even inside protocols like TLS (after the handshake).


### XOR Cipher ‚Äî Simplicity That Teaches
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Insecure. Demonstration-only (used in educational demos, malware obfuscation )

XOR is the simplest symmetric cipher: each byte of the message is XORed with a repeating key.
Reversibility is built-in ‚Äî XORing twice with the same key restores the original.

```rust
fn main() {
    let message = b"hello world";
    let key = b"key";

    let encrypted = xor_encrypt(message, key);
    let decrypted = xor_encrypt(&encrypted, key);

    println!("Encrypted: {:x?}", encrypted);
    println!("Decrypted: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&decrypted));
}

pub fn xor_encrypt(input: &[u8], key: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    input
        .iter()
        .enumerate()
        .map(|(i, &byte)| byte ^ key[i % key.len()])
        .collect()
}
```

The symmetric encryption can be reversible without storing state ‚Äî but XOR lacks confusion, diffusion, and resists no attacks.

### Feistel Networks ‚Äî Foundation of Classic Block Ciphers
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Cryptographically obsolete, but conceptually important (used in DES, 3DES)

Feistel networks are a clever way to build reversible encryption using any basic function‚Äîeven if that function itself can‚Äôt be reversed. That‚Äôs the key idea.

Each round:
Takes two halves: Left (L) and Right (R)
Computes a function f(R, key)
Updates the pair as:
```vbnet
L‚ÇÇ = R
R‚ÇÇ = L ‚äï f(R, key)
```

To encrypt, let‚Äôs see it in Rust:
```rust
fn feistel_round(l: u8, r: u8, k: u8) -> (u8, u8) {
    let f = r ^ k;
    (r, l ^ f)
}

fn main() {
    let left: u8 = 0b1010_1010;  // 170
    let right: u8 = 0b0101_0101; // 85
    let key: u8 = 0b1111_0000;   // 240

    let (new_left, new_right) = feistel_round(left, right, key);
    println!("Encrypted: ({}, {})", new_left, new_right);
}
```

To decrypt, use the same function f, but rearranged:

```rust
fn feistel_round(l: u8, r: u8, k: u8) -> (u8, u8) {
    let f = r ^ k;
    (r, l ^ f)
}

fn feistel_decrypt(nl: u8, nr: u8, k: u8) -> (u8, u8) {
    let f = nl ^ k;
    let l = nr ^ f;
    (l, nl)
}

fn main() {
    let left: u8 = 0b1010_1010;  // 170
    let right: u8 = 0b0101_0101; // 85
    let key: u8 = 0b1111_0000;   // 240

    let (new_left, new_right) = feistel_round(left, right, key);
    println!("Encrypted: ({}, {})", new_left, new_right);

    let (left_orig, right_orig) = feistel_decrypt(new_left, new_right, key);
    println!("Decrypted: ({}, {})", left_orig, right_orig);
}
```

Because we know:
```pgsql
Encrypted ‚Üí (R, L ‚äï f(R, k))
Decryption ‚Üí L = NewRight ‚äï f(NewLeft, k)
```

<br>

Reversibility comes from XOR being reversible and Swapping the halves.

Feistel networks let you build reversible encryption even with non-invertible functions.
This idea shaped DES and similar ciphers. 
Not used today due to known vulnerabilities, but conceptually essential.

### Substitution‚ÄìPermutation Networks (SPN)
üß† Used in AES, Camellia, and modern block ciphers
‚úÖ Still dominant in current cipher architectures

SPNs apply:

Substitution: introduce non-linearity via S-boxes

Permutation: shuffle bits or bytes to spread influence

Example (simplified S-box substitution):

```rust
let input: u8 = 0x53;
let s_box = [/* 256-byte S-box values */];
let output = s_box[input as usize];
```

‚úÖ SPNs offer confusion and diffusion, the two critical pillars for strong symmetric ciphers, as defined by Shannon.

### AES ‚Äî The Global Symmetric Standard
üß† Used in TLS, LUKS, SSH, mobile apps, and FIPS-certified systems
‚úÖ Secure, fast, and hardware-accelerated

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a block cipher:

Block size: 128 bits

Key sizes: 128, 192, or 256 bits

Based on SPN design with 10‚Äì14 rounds

```rust
use aes::Aes128;
use block_modes::{BlockMode, Cbc};
use block_modes::block_padding::Pkcs7;

type Aes128Cbc = Cbc<Aes128, Pkcs7>;
let cipher = Aes128Cbc::new_from_slices(key, iv).unwrap();
let ciphertext = cipher.encrypt_vec(plaintext);
```

‚úÖ Strong against known attacks when used with a secure mode (not ECB), unique IVs, and good key hygiene.

### ChaCha20 ‚Äî Modern Stream Cipher
üß† Used in WireGuard, mobile apps, TLS (non-AES platforms)
‚úÖ Fast, simple, and side-channel resistant

ChaCha20 is a stream cipher:

Converts key + nonce into a pseudorandom keystream

XORs that keystream with plaintext

No padding or block alignment required

```rust
use chacha20::cipher::{KeyIvInit, StreamCipher};

let mut cipher = chacha20::ChaCha20::new(key.into(), nonce.into());
let mut buffer = plaintext.to_vec();
cipher.apply_keystream(&mut buffer);
```

‚úÖ Safe by default, especially against timing attacks.
üö® Like all stream ciphers, never reuse a (key, nonce) pair.

### Modes of Operation
üß† Used to extend block ciphers to arbitrary-length messages
‚úÖ Secure when correctly applied; required for real-world encryption

Block ciphers like AES only process fixed-size blocks. Modes of operation define how to apply them to arbitrary-length messages.

Mode	Secure?	Use Case	Notes
ECB	‚ùå No	Educational only	Reveals structure (e.g. "Tux")
CBC	‚ö†Ô∏è Risky	Legacy systems	Needs random IV, padding errors
CTR	‚úÖ Yes	Streaming / fast I/O	Turns AES into stream cipher
XTS	‚úÖ Yes	Disk encryption	Sector-specific, not general use

CTR example:

```rust
use ctr::cipher::{KeyIvInit, StreamCipher};
let mut cipher = ctr::Ctr128BE::<Aes128>::new(key.into(), nonce.into());
cipher.apply_keystream(&mut buffer);
```

‚úÖ Modes are not optional‚Äîthey define the cipher‚Äôs real-world safety.

### AES vs. ChaCha20 ‚Äî Which to Choose?
üß† Used in virtually all secure communications
‚úÖ Choice depends on platform, speed, and implementation safety

Feature	AES (with mode)	ChaCha20
Type	Block cipher	Stream cipher
Speed	Hardware-accelerated	Fast on all CPUs
Complexity	Higher	Lower
Side-channel	Depends on impl	Timing-safe by design
Use Cases	File encryption, TLS	VPNs, mobile, embedded

‚úÖ Both are safe when used correctly. ChaCha20 is often the default when simplicity or portability is needed.

### A Glimpse at Key Derivation
üß† Used in password-based encryption and key expansion
‚úÖ Absolutely required in practice. Included here for context.

Users don‚Äôt enter 256-bit keys‚Äîthey type passwords. These must be turned into cryptographic keys with KDFs like:

```rust
use hkdf::Hkdf;
use sha2::Sha256;

let hk = Hkdf::<Sha256>::new(Some(salt), ikm);
let mut okm = [0u8; 32];
hk.expand(b"info", &mut okm).unwrap();
```

‚úÖ You'll revisit this in depth later. For now, remember: never use raw passwords as encryption keys.

### Summary

Why modes are critical‚Äîand where they fail

That encryption alone isn‚Äôt enough (spoiler: integrity comes next)
