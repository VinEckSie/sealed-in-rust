# Introduction

**Cryptography is everywhere — and yet most of us treat it like magic.**  

From encrypted chats and online banking to firmware updates on satellites, the systems we rely on daily are secured (or compromised) by cryptography. And too often, it fails — not because the math was wrong, but because the implementation was.

**This book exists to change that.**  

You’re not here to memorize equations. You’re here to understand, implement, and apply cryptographic primitives to real-world systems using a language designed to prevent mistakes before they happen: **Rust**.

Whether you're building infrastructure, smart contracts, embedded firmware, or secure APIs, this book gives you the tools to use cryptography safely, idiomatically, and fearlessly — one primitive, one project, one domain at a time.

## Who This Book Is For

- Rust developers who want to understand and apply cryptography
- Security engineers transitioning to Rust
- Curious hackers tired of black-box crypto
- Systems developers who care about safety, correctness, and resilience

## What You’ll Learn

- The foundations and mental models behind symmetric and asymmetric cryptography
- How to use modern cryptographic crates in Rust safely and idiomatically
- Where cryptographic primitives show up in real-world domains (blockchain, embedded, medical, etc.)
- How to design, test, and publish your own secure Rust crypto crate

## What This Book Is Not

- ❌ A math-heavy cryptography textbook
- ❌ A copy-paste cookbook
- ❌ A blockchain hype manual

We won’t drown you in proofs, but we’ll explain just enough math to build intuition. We’ll write real code — not just use libraries. And we’ll focus on systems-level crypto, not speculative tokens.

## What You’ll Need

- ✅ Basic experience with Rust (enough to build a CLI or follow `cargo run`)
- ✅ Comfort with reading code, refactoring, and using crates
- ✅ Curiosity, and a bias toward safe, practical, applied learning

## Let’s begin
This book won’t make you a cryptographer in the academic sense — but it will make you something just as rare and valuable:
A Rust engineer who understands, wields, and applies cryptography with precision, context, and confidence.


You won’t just read — you’ll build.
