A fearless journey into cryptography — written in Rust.

This book explores how real-world systems use cryptographic primitives to solve serious problems. Each chapter links code to purpose: not just how cryptography works, but **why it matters** — from secure login flows to zero-knowledge proofs.

- Domain-driven.  
- Practical.  
- Defense-grade where it counts.


## 📦 What to Expect

- Mental models and safe APIs  
- The best Rust crates for real-world crypto  
- Applied domains: identity, embedded, aerospace, and more  
- Modular, testable, auditable code
